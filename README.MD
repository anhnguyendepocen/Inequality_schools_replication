## Replication of "Inequalities in School Systems: Effect of School Structure or of Society Structure?""

[Inequalities in School Systems: Effect of School Structure or of Society Structure?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29727779?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) is a paper written by Vincent Dupriez and Xavier Dumay. In this repository I replicate their study to the closest possible and extend it to include new years and new indicators.
